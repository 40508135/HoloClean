This codebase was used for the testing and evaluation of various optimizers and hyperparameters for an honours project. The datasets tested can be found in the testdata directory, and directions for installing and running this framework has been described by the creators of this framework at https://github.com/HoloClean/holoclean.

This framework requires the installation of Postgres and Python, and uses several updated package versions with respect to the original framework. These updated package requirements can be found in the requirements.txt file. 
To use the LBFGS optimizer, replace the learn.py file used in the repair directory with the file provided in the main directory.
